OpenCopilot is a web app that you can embed in your app. You can embed the copilot in your app by using the `initAiCoPilot` function.

- Make sure to include the copilot script in your app.
```html
<script src="https://opencopilot.so/pilot.js"></script>
```

- In the head tag, add the following script to initialize the copilot.
```html
<script>
    initAiCoPilot({
        initialMessages: ["how are the things"], // optional: you can pass an array of messages that will be sent to the copilot when it's initialized
        token: "your_copilot_token_goes_here", // you can get your token from https://cloud.opencopilot.so
        triggerSelector: "#triggerSelector", // the selector of the element that will trigger the copilot when clicked
        headers: { // optional: you can pass your authentication tokens to the copilot or any other header you want to send with every request
            Authorization: "Bearer your_auth_token_goes_here",
        },
    });
</script>
```
