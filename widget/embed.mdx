OpenCopilot is a react web app that you can embed in your app. You can embed the copilot in your app as a simple js file and init it by using the `initAiCoPilot` function.

## How to embed the copilot in your app

1. Download the copilot script
   download the latest build from [Gtihub](https://github.com/openchatai/OpenCopilot/actions)
   and extract the zip file.
2. Make sure to include the copilot script in your app.
   ```html
   <script src="https://opencopilot.so/pilot.js"></script>
   ```
3. Init the copilot by calling the `initAiCoPilot` function.
   ```html
   <script>
     initAiCoPilot({
       initialMessages: ["how are the things"], // optional: you can pass an array of messages that will be sent to the copilot when it's initialized
       token: "your_copilot_token_goes_here", // you can get your token from https://cloud.opencopilot.so
       triggerSelector: "#triggerSelector", // the selector of the element that will trigger the copilot when clicked
       headers: {
         // optional: you can pass your authentication tokens to the copilot or any other header you want to send with every request
         Authorization: "Bearer your_auth_token_goes_here",
       },
     });
   </script>
   ```

  <Accordion title="the website is styled using tailwindcss is there will be style conflict?">
    Don't worry, the copilot is styled using
    [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) but all the classes are preifixed so
    there will be no style conflict.

    make sure that the `triggerSelector` is correct and the element exists in
