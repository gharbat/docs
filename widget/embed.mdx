OpenCopilot is a react web app that you can embed in your app. You can embed the copilot in your app as a simple js file and init it by using the `initAiCoPilot` function.

## How to embed the copilot in your app

1. Download the latest build from [GitHub](https://github.com/openchatai/OpenCopilot/actions)
   and extract the zip file.
2. Make sure to include the copilot script in your app.
   ```html
   <script src="https://yourdomain.com/pilot.js"></script>
   ```
3. Init the copilot by calling the `initAiCoPilot` function.

   - With Plain JS

   ```html
   <script>
     // be aware to call this function when the document/window is ready.
      function InitTheCopilot(){
       initAiCoPilot({
        apiUrl: "https://yourdomain.com/api" // your base url where your are hosting OpenCopilot at (the API), usually it's http://localhost:5000/api
        initialMessages: ["How are the things"], // optional: you can pass an array of messages that will be sent to the copilot when it's initialized
        token: "your_copilot_token_goes_here", // you can get your token from the dashboard
        triggerSelector: "#triggerSelector", // the selector of the element that will trigger the copilot when clicked
        headers: {
          // optional: you can pass your authentication tokens to the copilot or any other header you want to send with every request
          Authorization: "Bearer your_auth_token_goes_here",
          AnyKey: "AnyValue"
        },
      });

      window.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", InitTheCopilot); // window.onload
      }
   </script>
   ```

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I have a style conflict with the widget">
    The copilot is styled using
    [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) and all the classes are preifixed so it should not conflict with your
    exising style, however, if so, please feel free to [open an issue on our GitHub repo](https://github.com/openchatai/OpenCopilot/issues/new)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The copilot widget is not showing up">
    Make sure that the `triggerSelector` is correct and the element exists in
    the dom, if that did not work, please [open an issue on our GitHub repo](https://github.com/openchatai/OpenCopilot/issues/new)
